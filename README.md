# Patient-Condition-Categorization-From-Drug-Reviews-Using-Natural-Language-Processing

## Introduction

Over time, the internet has undergone significant transformations. Initially, it primarily served as a platform for individuals to promote their businesses. However, the internet has now evolved into a platform where consumers assess a variety of services and products based on feedback from fellow consumers. This approach of utilizing reviews and feedback to gauge the excellence of a product or service can also be extended to the healthcare sector. Lately, online reviews have been instrumental in establishing novel domains within the realm of communication and marketing. Consequently, this has played a pivotal role in narrowing the gap between viral feedback and traditional word-of-mouth communication. Such dynamics hold considerable potential to substantially shape consumer perceptions.

Within the healthcare sphere, drug evaluations encompass a heightened significance, assuming a pivotal role in various capacities. These assessments offer multifaceted assistance, serving several purposes. Notably, they facilitate the vigilant tracking of adverse reactions linked to diverse medications, enable the discernment of collective sentiments surrounding specific drugs, and foster the identification of a given drug's efficacy across varying illnesses. In the context of patient forums, emphasizing the precise medical ailment for which a medication is prescribed holds paramount importance. This precautionary measure is imperative due to the broad spectrum of conditions that numerous drugs can effectively address.

This research endeavor aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of drug reviews with the goal of predicting specific medical conditions for individual patients. These reviews, sourced from diverse patients across various medicine review platforms, constitute the dataset for investigation. The project's core objective involves the development of a medical condition classification system, harnessing patients' drug reviews to anticipate their underlying health issues.

The chosen dataset for this endeavor is the Drug Review Dataset, obtainable from UCI's Machine Learning Repository. The research will employ multiple techniques for feature extraction, encompassing vectorization methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, GloVe, and Word2Vec. These techniques transform the textual data into numerical representations for subsequent analysis.

The cornerstone of the research lies in the construction of a robust classification system capable of attributing predicted medical conditions to patients based on their reviews of different drugs. To achieve this, a spectrum of machine learning classification algorithms will be deployed. These include Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the SGD Classifier. Each algorithm will contribute its unique approach to categorization, enhancing the system's accuracy and comprehensiveness.

By integrating these components, this research aspires to establish a sophisticated framework for predicting patients' medical conditions through the analysis of drug reviews, ultimately contributing to advancements in healthcare analysis and personalized treatment strategies.
