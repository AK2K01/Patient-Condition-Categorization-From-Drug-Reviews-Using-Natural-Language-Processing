Over time, the internet has undergone significant transformations. Initially, it primarily served as a platform for individuals to promote their businesses. However, the internet has now evolved into a platform where consumers assess a variety of services and products based on feedback from fellow consumers. This approach of utilizing reviews and feedback to gauge the excellence of a product or service can also be extended to the healthcare sector.
